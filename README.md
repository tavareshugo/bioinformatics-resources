# Bioinformatics Resources Hub

Links to books, tutorials and course materials for bioinformatics applications. 

We do not intend for this to be an exhaustive repository of software packages or their documentation/vignettes. 
Rather, we focus on detailed and self-contained resources suitable both for self-learners and teachers looking for inspiration. 
The materials listed are all freely available, in most cases with a permissible license (CC-BY), allowing you to use them in your own teaching.
